Dwarf,"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. ","Your Constitution score increases by 2. You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.  You have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage.  You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.  You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish."
Elf,"Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.","Your Dexterity score increases by 2.  You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.  You have proficiency in the Perception skill.  Magic can't put you to sleep.  Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.  You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish."
Human,"In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.","Your ability scores each increase by 1. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.  "
Dragonborn,"Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Som e dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
","Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma increases by 1.  You have draconic ancestry which grants you a breath weapon based on your color.  Colors include Black, Blue, Brass, Bronze, Copper, Gold, Green, Red, Silver, White.  You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.  You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.  "
Gnome,"A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close- knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.","Your Intelligence score increases by 2.  You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.  You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.  You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish.  "
Tiefling,"To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.","Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.  Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You have resistance to fire damage.  You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish rebuke spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.  You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal."
